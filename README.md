Porssari client scripts for Shelly devices

# Tweaked release/porssari-main-script.js
Additional management for "switch:0".
Tested and used with Shelly Plus2PM.

"switch:0" engages only if all inputs are true: Porssari (Price), "switch:1" (Location), "input:0" (Thermostat).

"switch:1" can be controlled with other software (ie. location-based routines in Google Home).
